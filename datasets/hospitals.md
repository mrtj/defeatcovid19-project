# Onboarding Hospitals and Medical Clinics
Our effort to obtain as many datasets as possible is directed towards every hospital and medical clinic we can contact. 

A number of datasets are already available, but very few are related to COVID19. Moreover a lot of data is missing related to patients conditions and medical imaging. We aim to fill this gap and make dataset available to everyone.

### Data required
We could collect a number of data from hospitals, here the list:

- RX: Radiographic images of lungs (healthy, pneumonia, and if available, COVID-19 patients)
- ECOH: Ultrasound images of hearth (healthy, pneumonia, and if available, COVID-19 patients)
- CT: Computed Tomography of lungs (healthy, pneumonia, and if available, COVID-19 patients)
- CD: Clinical Data (Clinical History, existing pathologies, Sympthoms)


### Onboarding status
Usually onboarding process follows these steps:

1. First contact
2. Brief introductory call about project objectives
3. Project description and data request sent
4. Waiting ethical committee approval (if required)
5. Waiting for data
6. Data received
7. Dataset available
